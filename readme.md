This package is not a replacement for Laravel's default Auth library, but instead something
that sits between your code and the library.

Think of it as a factory class for Auth. Now, instead of having a single table/model to
authenticate users against, you can now have multiple, and unlike the previous version of
this package, you have access to all functions, and can even use a different driver 
for each user type.

On top of that, you can use multiple authentication types, simultaneously, so you can be logged
in as a user, a master account and an admin, without conflicts!
